## Observations
- good points
  - keep track states of req: `loading` || `error` || `success` || `fetching` with nice api
  - avoid doing things like `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)`
  - do retries in case of failure
  - decide when to refetch a query
    - `refetchOnWindowFocus`
    - `staleTime`
      - out-of-the-box: done `fetching` -> `stale`
      - `staleTime` is how long a query remains `fresh` after done fetching
    - `cacheTime`: component get unmounted, how long query stay `inactive` (in cache) ?
  - can parameterize component by `queryKey` used inside
  - same queryKeys produce only 1 network req
  - can abtract query into custom hook, to reuse between components
  - queries run parallel
  - can cache search result
  - can set condition when to start a query by `enabled`
